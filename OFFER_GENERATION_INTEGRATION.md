# Offer Letter Generation & Storage Integration

## Overview
This implementation integrates offer letter generation with Supabase storage bucket and the offers database table, providing a complete workflow from template selection to offer management.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Storage Bucket Setup**
- **Created**: `create_offer_letters_bucket.sql` 
- **Bucket**: `offer-letters` (private bucket)
- **Features**:
  - 50MB file size limit
  - Supports PDF and DOCX files
  - Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
  - User-based folder structure

### 2. **Enhanced Offer Generation Workflow**
**File**: `src/components/OfferWorkflowManager.tsx`

#### Key Features Added:
- **Template Selection**: Users can select from uploaded templates or upload new ones
- **Field Extraction**: Dynamic field extraction from templates using SimplifyHR API
- **File Storage**: Generated PDFs are automatically saved to Supabase bucket
- **Database Integration**: Creates records in the `offers` table
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### 3. **Offer Record Creation**
When an offer is generated, the system automatically:

1. **Downloads Generated Files**: Retrieves PDF and DOCX from SimplifyHR API
2. **Uploads to Bucket**: Saves PDF to `offer-letters` bucket with organized folder structure:
   ```
   offer-letters/
   └── {user_id}/
       └── {job_application_id}/
           └── offer_letter_{timestamp}.pdf
   ```
3. **Creates Database Record**: Inserts into `offers` table with:
   - Job application reference
   - Salary and compensation details
   - Offer letter URL
   - Status tracking
   - Audit logs
   - Negotiation history

### 4. **Enhanced UI Features**

#### Template Management:
- Visual template selection interface
- Upload new templates on-the-fly
- Template validation indicators

#### Offer Viewing:
- Download generated PDFs/DOCX files
- View offer letters in browser
- Status indicators for generated offers
- Generated date tracking

#### Status Tracking:
- Visual indicators for offer generation status
- Download buttons for generated files
- View buttons for stored offers

## 📋 Database Schema Integration

The implementation works with your existing `offers` table schema:

```sql
- job_application_id: Links to job application
- salary_amount: Extracted from offer fields
- currency: Currency from offer data
- offer_letter_url: URL to stored PDF in bucket
- status: Set to 'draft' initially
- benefits: JSON array of benefits
- signing_bonus: Bonus amount
- equity_percentage: Equity percentage
- logs: Audit trail of offer generation
- negotiation_history: History tracking
```

## 🔧 API Integration

### SimplifyHR API Workflow:
1. **Template Upload**: Upload template to SimplifyHR
2. **Field Extraction**: Extract dynamic fields from template
3. **Data Collection**: Collect field values from user
4. **Offer Generation**: Generate PDF/DOCX with filled data
5. **File Download**: Download generated files
6. **Storage**: Save to Supabase bucket
7. **Database**: Create offer record

## 🚀 Usage Flow

1. **Select Workflow**: Choose a job application workflow
2. **Generate Offer**: Click "Generate Offer" button
3. **Choose Template**: Select from uploaded templates or upload new one
4. **Extract Fields**: System automatically extracts template fields
5. **Fill Data**: Complete the dynamic form with offer details
6. **Generate**: System creates offer letter and saves everything
7. **View/Download**: Access generated offers through UI

## 🔐 Security Features

- **RLS Policies**: User can only access their own organization's offers
- **Private Bucket**: Offer letters are not publicly accessible
- **Folder Structure**: Organized by user and job application
- **Audit Logs**: Complete tracking of offer generation activities

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `create_offer_letters_bucket.sql` - Storage bucket setup

### Modified Files:
- `src/components/OfferWorkflowManager.tsx` - Enhanced with offer generation and storage
- `src/services/offerLetterApi.ts` - Updated with environment variables
- `.env` - Added API URL configuration

## 🧪 Testing Checklist
